## bootpack
`bootpack` is a boilerplate template to create multi-page websites using bootstrap for development and webpack for task running. View the latest version at [https://bootpack.github.io/bootpack/](https://bootpack.github.io/bootpack/).

**Bootstrap + Webpack = &hearts;**
- **Just Develop:** 4 steps to [get started](#installation). Launch a dev server with live reloading.
- **Pre-Configured:** A pre-configured webpack config simplifies overcomplicated build processes.
- **Predictable File Output:** Keep your CSS where you want it; out of your JavaScript files! The `dist` directory will closely match the `src` directory.
- **Minified Files:** JavaScript and CSS is minified and output as single files.
- **Compressed Resources:** JS, CSS, fonts, images and favicons are gzipped for maximum compression.
- **Dev and Production Builds:** [Build](#build) the project in development mode with sourcemapping enabled or production mode.
- **Development Tools:** Generate & compress images + more [tools](#tools) to ease web development.
- **Built-In Tests:** Lint JavaScript and CSS files with [one command](#test).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- This project uses [Node.js v8.15.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

### Use bootpack as a template (Option 1)

*Using bootpack as template is the recommended method.*

1. To get started, click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository.   
![Use this template button](.github/images/use_this_template_button.jpg?raw=true "Use this template")

2. After clicking the "Use this template" button, you will be asked to enter a name for a new repostiory. This repository will be generated with all of the bootpack repositoryâ€™s files and folders.   

3. Next, simply perform the following commands in your terminal to get started, replacing `[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY_NAME]` with the location and repository names you chose in the previous step.

```
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY_NAME].git
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Fork/Clone bootpack  (Option 2)

bootpack can also be forked into your own repository and cloned or cloned directly using the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/bootpack/bootpack.git
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in a browser. 
- Save a file in the project to refresh the browser. 
- Press ctrl+c in the terminal to stop serving.

## Usage
### Build
`npm run build` - Creates the project in **production** mode (minified) and outputs to the dist directory.   
`npm run watch` - Creates the project in **development** mode (unminified). This mode watches for changes and outputs to the dist directory.   
`npm start` - Creates the project in **development** mode (unminified). This mode watches for changes, outputs to the dist directory and live reloades the page.

### Test
`npm run test` - Runs lint tests (+ additional unit and e2e tests can be added here as needed)   
`npm run lint` - Runs `npm run lint:js` and `npm run lint:styles`   
`npm run lint:js` - Runs eslint test on `src/*/*.js` files   
`npm run lint:css` - Runs stylelint test on `src/css/*.css` files   
`npm run lint:scss` - Runs stylelint test on `src/scss/*.scss` files   
`npm run lint:styles` - Runs `npm run lint:css` and `npm run lint:scss`

### Tools
`npm run compress:images` 
- Optimizes images in the `images` directory, saves original images to `images-original`.   
- Run before building or during watch. Only the `images` directory will be copied to the `dist` directory.   
- Edit `tools/image-compress.js` to change the image compress. See: https://www.npmjs.com/package/compress-images for settings

`npm run generate:images width ### height ###` 
- Creates a placeholder.jpg image in the `images` directory   
- Replace `###` with a numeric value representing wwidth and height. If no width/height is specified, the placeholder will default to 800px x 600px.

## About
### Webpack 4
#### Webpack: Builds
The webpack build creates a `dist` directory that closely mimics the `src` directory. 
- In production mode, the `dist` directory contains files that are minified & compressed. 
- In development mode, files are kept unminified with sourcemapping turned on as needed & no compression output. 
- Webpack server is available to speed up development via live browser refreshes on code change while preserving the ability to inspect the `dist` directory. 

The `src` directory contains starter files to get your project off the ground quickly.

#### Webpack: Process
The webpack task runner builds the site with the following commands:
- `npm run build` will build production. 
- `npm run watch` builds development mode and watches for file changes. 
- `npm start` builds development mode, watches for file changes, opens the browser and refreshes when files change.
1. The `dist` directory is cleaned on first built or modified on change (`npm start` or `npm run watch`).
2. `src/**/*.html` is copied to `dist/**/*.html`
3. Favicons are generated and injected into the dist index.html file from the `src/favicon.png` file. 
4. Bootstrap components are imported into the index.js and output to `dist/index.js`.
5. CSS/SCSS files in `src/css/` and `src/scss/` are bundled together, minified and output to `dist/styles.css`.
6. Images and fonts are copied from `src/images` -> `dist/images` and `src/fonts` -> `dist/fonts`.
7. Files are compressed with gzip compression.

### Bootstrap 4
#### Bootstrap: SCSS Files
Bootstrap 4 is imported into `scss/boostrap.scss` via `@import "~bootstrap/scss/*bootstrap*";` import rules. Optional components can be excluded by commenting out the `@import` rules in this file (**recommended to minimize bundle size**). 

##### SCSS/CSS Overrides & Custom Styles:
- `scss/variables.scss` is included to override all of bootstrap's built in variables.
- `scss/custom.scss` is included to add custom scss to the project.
- `css/custom.css` is included to add custom css to the project.
- `css/fonts.css` is included to import local fonts into the project. Open Sans has been included as an example.

#### Bootstrap: JS Files
Bootstap 4 is imported in the index.js file via `bootstrap.bundle` which contains the full bootstrap JavaScript plus the `popper.js` tooltip dependency.   Below the `bootstrap.bundle` import, comments contain other methods to import bootstrap. End-users may choose to import `bootstrap.bundle`, `bootstrap`, or individual components (**recommended to minimize bundle size**).
